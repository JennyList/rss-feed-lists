# RSS feeds for news trend research

This repository contains a set of lists of RSS news feeds for national newspapers and broadcasters.

They're here for researchers, I collected them because of my work with [https://github.com/JennyList/word-trend-analysis](my word trend nalysis tool for news content).

In putting together these lists I found an RSS ecosystem that's still surprisingly intact; while some organisations have turned off their feeds, many still retain them even if they are no longer advertised.

So far I have feed lists for two countries:

## UK:

[./UK-feeds.md](UK news feed list)

## USA

[./US-feeds.md](USA news feed list)
